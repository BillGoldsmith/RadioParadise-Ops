        This will download an up to date mailing list from the master database.
        It should be imported to the existing mailing list  "Listeners".

        Click download link below.
        Open Sendy link below.  Select choose file and then click import.

        And when completed,  any segments will need to be manually refreshed.

        Eventually we'll be able to automate the above.
